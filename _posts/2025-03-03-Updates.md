description: A short update from 2024, and 2025 page goals.
---

It has been quite a while since I posted here. But I am setting a goal for myself to update this page as often as possible this year. 

Last year became a busy year for me. I started to dive into learning more Python, and I wrote two scripts for my team at Amazon. One of the scripts got me an award which definitely surprised me. The progress keeps going and hopefully this year I can continue to do more.

The plan for this page this year is to document things I am learning on my own as I work towards trying to get into the security field. I am currently going through the tryhackme Security Engineer path, and it has been quite enjoyable so far. As I finish rooms my plan is to make a write up on what I learned, what I found interesting, and what relates to real world things I have seen in my current job. I feel that writing information down helps me to recall it better, so what better way than to put it here. 

A new year means new goals, and this year I hope to make good progress into getting into the cybersecurity field.
