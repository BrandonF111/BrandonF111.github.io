description: My thoughts on now to get into the cybersecurity mindset further
---

This is a thought process I've been trying to figure out for a while. The thinking process of someone working within cybersecurity. Sometimes within conversation it flows like I know what I'm talking about, other times it feels like i have no clue what I am doing. 

I even asked AI for how to understand the thought process and it actually gave some good tips and things I can do. Unfortunately within my current job, my day-to-day does not involve this thinking so it's up to me to work on understanding it. My goal for the upcoming new year is to work to understand the thought process that will allow me to work through cybersecurity issues and to start to wire my brain to think in that way first. Plus a few projects I am going to work on to bolster my skills and resume. Also I need to work on writing down my thoughts more and posting them on here as I continue my journey.
