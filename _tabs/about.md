Hello, my name is Brandon. I'm 30 years old and currently work in IT Support at Amazon. I'm currently working to get into the cybersecurity field, I enjoy the challenge and love learning new things within this field. This site is a way for me to basically create a record of things I'm currently doing to achieve my goal. 

Outside of that I enjoy working out, sports car racing, 3D printing, and being my own personal bartender. I used to chase down rare bottles of Bourbon, but not so much anymore. Hopefully I can get a semi rare bottle soon.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you would like to reach out to me please use one of the social links at the bottom left of the page.
